## Exercise 07  : [Qt Bubble App](qt_bubble_app) - ready 100%.

In this exercise, I learned how to develop a simple QT application from scratch. The code is fully implemented, but there were some problems with running (or installing) the application on the android simulator on Mac OS.  
Unfortunately I did not like Qt. Perhaps I just need to get used to it or dive deeper into the study of this [framework](https://www.qt.io/).  

## Exercise 08  : Qt Speed Game - not implemented.

The reason is above.

## Exercise 09: [Bitkoin Fetcher](pwa_bitcoin_fetcher) - ready 100%.

This application implements the basic principles of [PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps) development, such us:  

- creating a app manifest file  
- registering service worker in index.html  
- understand install, activate and fetch events in service worker  
- caching files to use offline mode  
- fetching bitcoin value from the web  
- saving data to device's local storage  
- basic use of chrome development tools with PWA

## Exercise 10: [Sodexo](react-pwa-sodexo) - ready 100%.

This sipmle [PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps) application was implemented using the component approach of [React](https://reactjs.org/) library.

## Exercise 11: [Ads](react_native_ads) - ready 100%.

This example Ads application was implemented using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/), package manager [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) (before that I used exclusively [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)) and react-native [module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-admob) for Google AdMob GADBanner, DFPBanner and GADInterstitial   library.

## Exercise 12: Course feedback and self evaluation - ready 100%.

- How you feel the content of the course (overall)?  
*It was an excellent, informative course with wonderful examples and tutorials on modern mobile development technologies.*  

- How you feel the course web site and materials in Labranet GitLab?  
*Good site design, it was convenient to study materials.*  

- Is the material suitable for a contact/virtual study? If not, what should be improved?  
*In my opinion, the material is suitable for both of these options.*  

- How about workload (low, ok, too much)?  
*I had a slightly reduced workload on this course, as there was sufficient experience in the react-native development and the lecturer approved part of the tasks for me, so it is difficult for me to be objective in this matter. But still, I think the workload is quite acceptable.*  

- Give a rating number from 1-5 (5 == excellent) to this course at overal.  
*5!*

- Self evaluation.  
*It is always difficult to evaluate yourself. This is not entirely objective. If you take into account the criteria for assessing the course, then this is 5: total exercises done: 11/12 = 92% (that more than 90%).*
